[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=ableton,apple,bash,discord,css,github,html,javascript,vscode,ps,pr)](https://skill-icons-builder.vercel.app/)

I'm Ferret, a passionate developer interested in full-stack development, anime and AI. I use Tokyo Night btw.

You may know me for my YouTube channel, Ferretosan - but you probably know me as the founder of VoxelCube and some of my popular projects.

Make sure to check out VoxelCube and Cosmos Entertainment! And btw, *I'm always watching. You need to make sure you do, otherwise things might happen.*
