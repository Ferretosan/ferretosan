# Ferret â™¥ï¸Ž

> It works on my PC

I'm Ferret, a passionate developer interested in full-stack development, anime and AI.

You may know me for my YouTube channel, Ferretosan - but you probably know me as the founder of VoxelCube and some of my popular projects.

Make sure to check out VoxelCube and Cosmos Entertainment! And btw, *I'm always watching. You need to make sure you do, otherwise things might happen.*
